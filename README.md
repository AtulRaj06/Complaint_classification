# Complaint_classification
Develop a ML model to classify new complaints arriving from a stream of complaints web portal and assign a department to work on it. 

A financial service company is a distribution logistics business unit and receiving complaints from its customers
through sources of call centre, mails, paper mode, each branch offices, retail offices, back
operation offices. It has become very difficult to manage complaints to process and feedback to
business for corrections and improvement.

So they have decided to launch a web application in their website and manage all the
complaints in a single database through web based application.
